Johnson *et al*. (2014)
=======================

This folder contains the code necessary to rerun the analysis from
Johnson *et al*. (2014) using the 
[ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim) package.

Summary: Using [ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim), Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the ability of statistical age-structured models to estimate spawning-stock biomass, fishing mortality, and total allowable catch when natural mortality varied with time in the true population but was unaccounted for in the estimation methods.

Please direct all questions regarding the code to 
Kelli Johnson (<kellifayejohnson@gmail.com>).
